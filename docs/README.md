# Docs

Repository documentation is grouped by purpose:

- `database-migration-workflow.md` - migration standards and release safety.
- `unraid-release-runbook.md` - Unraid deployment and rollback flow.
- `status/` - project state snapshots and progress notes.
- `plans/` - implementation plans and execution checklists.
